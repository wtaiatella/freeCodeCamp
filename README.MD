# freeCodeCamp Repository

freeCodeCamp was one of my first online coding courses. It was very helpfull with a lot of exercicies and projetcs.

I'm still working on the Responsive Web Disigned Projetcs and the exercicies of JavaScript Course.

Here are the files created during my studies and few free to watch them.
